With this preset, you can use 11 switches: the 10 normal footswitches
+ the bypass switch.

The Ultrafoot should be in Mode 2 (the one where all of the switches
light up individually--NOT patch select mode).

This could have other uses as well: Basically, the Ultrafoot now sends
Momentary CC messages.
