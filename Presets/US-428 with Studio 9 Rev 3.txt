Notes:				Control Pinnacles Studio 9 with the US-428!

				The data wheel for the slider's cannot be used
				to brush the timeline. I use it to start Rewind and
				FFW instead which is very convenient with the additional
				Stop button in reach. I've -/+ 1 frame assigned to the
				REW and F FW buttons instead.
