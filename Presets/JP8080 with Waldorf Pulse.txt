Controlling the Pulse with the JP-8080

With a suitable MIDI Mapper program (such as MIDI Translator) you can
easily convert controllre messages to other controller messages in
real tie. This allows you to, for instance, control most of the
parameters of your Waldorf Pulse by tweaking the knobs of your JP-8080
(if you happen to have both, as I do).

There's currently no documentation suplied with the .bmtp file so here
are some basic installation instructions. Use the File|Import Presets
menu to load "JP8080 with Waldorf Pulse.bmtp". This will install my
preset. Make sure you have selected MIDI mode 2 (with the standard
settings) in the MIDI menu of the 8080 and make sure you have turned
MIDI Thru on in MIDI Translator. That's it. I don't remember anymore
what JP knobs did what (and I cannot check it at the moment) so just
try what each knob does. However, I remember trying to keep the layout
logical, envelopes correspond to envelopes and the pitch envelope on
the JP adjusts the osc levels, to give you some examples. This is an
early version of the preset file so not every knob may work. If you
find any bugs, please contact me via e-mail:
