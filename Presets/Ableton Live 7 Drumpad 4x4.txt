Trigger an Ableton 7 drum rack using the computer keyboard
----------------------------------------------------------

Preset made by user "quoke".

I just setup MT to trigger an Ableton 7 drum rack using the
computer keyboard; thought others might want it. I'd imagine
this could be used with other software expecting inputs from
a 4x4 drum pad as well.

The trigger keys are
	1 2 3 4
	Q W E R
	A S D F
	Z X C V

Also, pressing "G" moves the 4x4 pad up to the next higher
virtual drum pad (by increasing each of the pads note value
by 16), and "B" moves down the next lower virtual drum pad.

The velocity starts at 64. Hitting "H" will increase the
velocity of future notes by 10. Hitting "N" will decrease it
by 10.
